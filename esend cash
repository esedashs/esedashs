Your relationship with money is often a result of how your parents treated their own money. Some young adults picked up bad habits and never learned to understand the negatives of credit card usage. For those of you looking for help from your local payday loan provider, you are probably experiencing one of the side effects of not understanding how credit cards will affect personal finances.

*Credit cards play a big part of credit scores. Good management and longevity are two key factors.

- Pay creditors on time.

- Leave less than 30% of credit limit as a balance transferred to the following month.

- Don't cancel old accounts unless absolutely necessary.

- Use all cards in rotation. Make a small charge and pay it off. Use a different card each month to keep them active.

These lessons are rarely learned until it is time to climb out of a pile of unaffordable debt.
