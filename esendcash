As Americans, we have adopted a lifestyle that doesn't encourage saving and almost glamorizes debt. It has become easier than ever to find money for life's little emergencies. While everyone has an emergency from time to time, the companies that offer financing for these situations often start a vicious cycle of debt. Once you have maxed out your credit cards and spent that money you were saving, this is the inevitable time that you will have your car break down, or you will need to get to the doctor's office... the list of emergencies can be endless.

Many people have entered the payday loan centers, where it seems like a quick fix until payday to borrow a few hundred dollars for a seemingly small amount. The 17% doesn't seem like a big price to pay to get you out of a bind, but what many of these people don't realize is that totals up to a staggering 400% in a year! This can quickly escalate into a burden for the middle and lower income families who use these services. If you want to know how to get out of this payday loan debt, the answers are simple - even though sometimes changing the behavior isn't.
